                I'm a small town guy with big dreams.
                I grew up loving to make things with my bare hands.
                From arts and crafts to woodshop, I'm at peace when I'm creating.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I got older my ideas became harder and harder to create.
                I needed a new medium to keep myself busy.
                That's when I found code.

                After spending 2 years on my AS in Computer Science, 
                and a 12 week intensive bootcamp at VSchool, 
                I know spend my time creating or updating my apps.
